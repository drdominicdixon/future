## Introduction

Pornogr@phyand its devastating consequences on the Youth & Women in the Nation of India

Dr. Dominic F. Dixon (Psychologist)

    What is Pornography? The word pornography is composed of two Greek words. The first is porne, meaning “harlot,” which is akin to the word pernanai, meaning “to sell.” The second word is graphein, meaning “to write.”1 In other words, pornography is literally “the writing of harlots.” Webster’s New Collegiate Dictionary, G. & C. Merriam Co., p. 888.﻿

(HSI) Ethos Institute’s Youth research & Development wing, More Love, has been in the field of research of Youth and sexual behaviour for the last twelve years. All research conducted by this institution has been done objectively, not by merely gathering already researched statistics and data, but by essentially engaging with youth of all demography. In regards to visibility and recognition of our research work, we have been interviewed in over a hundred provinces worldwide and news channels such as CNN, Agence France Presse, Khaleej Times, Raipei Times, US Politics Today, Deccan Chronicle, India Today, NDTV, Headlines Today, News9, Yahoo and others.

A research paper was presented to the Prime Minister of India and to the President of India on Adolescent Psychology & Sociology and sexual behaviours.

The aim of this Paper is to identify objectively, the role of pornography in the cases of rape and sexual assault and deviant behaviour.

Research indicates that many of the youth in India who have been engaged in pornography, have acted out on innocent victims to the point of molesting and raping them. There have been several instances of men acting out on their wives, what they saw during pornography, thus treating their wives as sex objects, and as a commodity. This family situation contributes to separation and divorces.

While the crime of rape has always existed, there however now exists an epidemic of rapes crimes, no matter how tough the laws against this crime may be. If such harsh punishments such as the death penalty and life sentences are not stopping people from committing this crime, then there has to be a greater reason as to why men still rape women. A man who is poor and hungry, steals food to soothe his hunger pangs, even though he knows that stealing will get him in trouble with the law. Inasmuch the same way, why do men still rape when they know that the law is so harsh against these crimes? Why are they not able to contain themselves and what is it that is compelling them to rape? Is there something happening in the brain of the user of pornography?


This paper attempts to produce answers to these nagging questions!
